# Wine Dataset Analysis: EDA and Classification with Machine Learning
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and classification modeling on the Wine dataset, which contains chemical analysis of wines derived from three different cultivars.

Objective:
Explore the dataset thoroughly and understand patterns and feature relationships
Apply machine learning models to classify wine types accurately

Tools & Technologies:
Python: NumPy, Pandas
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (modeling, preprocessing, evaluation)
 
Results:
All final visualizations, key findings, and interpretations are compiled in:
Wine_Data_Analysis.pdf - This document provides a complete summary of both the EDA and the machine learning results.

Python Scripts:
a) Wine_DescriptiveAnalysis.py
Performs summary statistics
Generates plots to explore feature distributions and class-wise differences

b) Wine_logistic_regression_classification.py
Implements classification model (Logistic Regression)
Evaluates performance (accuracy, precision, recall)
Generates feature importance plots

Run scripts from terminal:
python Wine_DescriptiveAnalysis.py
python Wine_logistic_regression_classification.py
