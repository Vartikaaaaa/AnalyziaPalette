 Wine Dataset Analysis: EDA and Classification with Machine Learning
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and classification modeling on the Wine dataset, which contains chemical analysis of wines derived from three different cultivars. The goal is to explore the dataset, understand its underlying patterns, and apply machine learning models to classify wine types accurately.

Tools & Technologies
a) Python (NumPy, Pandas)
b) Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
c) Scikit-learn (Modeling, preprocessing, evaluation)
