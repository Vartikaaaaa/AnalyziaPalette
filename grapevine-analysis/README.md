# 🍷 Wine Dataset Analysis: EDA and Classification with Machine Learning

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **classification modeling** on the Wine dataset, which contains chemical analysis of wines derived from three different cultivars.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Explore the dataset thoroughly and understand patterns and feature relationships  
- Apply machine learning models to classify wine types accurately

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: NumPy, Pandas  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (modeling, preprocessing, evaluation)

---

## 📄 Results

All final visualizations, key findings, and interpretations are compiled in:  
📘 **[Wine_Data_Analysis.pdf](./Wine_Data_Analysis.pdf)**  
This document provides a complete summary of both the EDA and the machine learning results.
